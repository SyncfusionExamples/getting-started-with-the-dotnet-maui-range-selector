# Getting Started with the .NET MAUI Range Selector
The [.NET MAUI Range Selector](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-range-selector?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-range-selector-github-samples) is a highly interactive UI control for selecting a smaller range from a larger data set. A quick-start project that helps you to integrate a Range Selector control in a .NET MAUI application by adding the Syncfusion MAUI Sliders package from NuGet. This project contains simple code customizations, like how to add content; set minimum and maximum values with intervals; and add labels, tooltips, ticks, and dividers.

## Project prerequisites
Make sure that you have the compatible versions of [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the Dot NET MAUI workload and [.NET Core SDK 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) or later version in your machine before starting to work on this project.

## How to run this application
To run this application, you need to first clone the `getting-started-with-the-dotnet-maui-range-selector` repository and then open it in Visual Studio 2022. Now, simply build and run your project to view the output.

## Features and Benefits

## Content

Add your content of choice, including any MAUI control. The Range Selector is smart enough to handle functions like segment selection and chart zooming based on the range specified.

## Ticks

Set both major and minor ticks in the track. Use major ticks to show the intervals clearly and minor ticks to help users choose values between two intervals easily.

## Dividers

Render [dividers](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/range-selector/divider) in each interval to show the ranges accurately. Customize the size and appearance of the dividers.

## Labels

Customize the [labels](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/range-selector/labels) easily. Change their format, render them at specific intervals, and add prefixes and suffixes.

## Tooltips

Use [tooltips](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/range-selector/tooltip) to indicate the current selection during interaction. Customize the format, entire text, and visibility of the tooltip.
