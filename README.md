# getting-started-with-the-dotnet-maui-range-selector
A quick-start project that helps you to integrate a Range Selector control in a .NET MAUI application by adding the Syncfusion MAUI Sliders package from NuGet. This project contains simple code customizations, like how to add content; set minimum and maximum values with intervals; and add labels, tooltips, ticks, and dividers.
